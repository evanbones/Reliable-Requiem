## About

**Reliable Requiem** is a highly configurable death penalty and death recovery mod, based on the features
of [Corpse Complex](https://modrinth.com/mod/corpse-complex) for 1.16.5. It gives modpack
makers and players control over exactly what happens when you die, from inventory management to respawn
conditions, offering a customizable alternative to the `keepInventory` gamerule.

## Features

### Inventory Control

You can configure percentage chances to keep items in specific inventory sections (Hotbar, Armor, Offhand, and Main
Inventory).

* **Durability Penalty:** Apply a configurable percentage of durability loss to items that are kept through death.
* **Item Overrides:** Specify exact items to always keep, always drop, or be completely destroyed on death.
* **Tag Support:** Built-in support for the `c:soulbound` enchantment tag and an additional
  `reliable_requiem:retained_on_death` item tag to retain specific items.

### Death Drops

Tired of losing your items to creepers or the despawn timer?

* **Protected Drops:** Make your death drops immune to explosions and prevent them from ever despawning.
* **Condense Drops:** Group all dropped items and experience orbs to prevent
  scattering.

### Respawning

Customize the exact state the player is in when they return to life:

* **Hunger & Saturation:** Choose to keep your food and saturation levels, or enforce minimum and maximum food caps upon
  respawning.
* **Health Scaling:** Respawn with a percentage of your maximum health or set a hard cap on respawn health.
* **Status Effects:** Configurable options to let positive or negative potion effects persist through death.
* **Experience Tweaks:** Control the exact percentage of XP lost, how much drops per level, and the maximum dropped XP.
* **Randomized Respawn:** Add a configurable random radius to your respawn location to make getting back to your base a
  bit more challenging.

### Memento Mori

An optional, custom post-death debuff. When enabled, players respawn with the **Memento Mori** effect, which temporarily
reduces movement speed and attack damage. The duration and severity of the debuff are configurable.

### Quality of Life Tweaks

* **Death Coordinates:** Optionally display your exact death coordinates directly on the death screen.
* **Bypass Rules:** Disable keep-inventory tweaks entirely for specific dimensions or specific damage sources.

## Configuration

Reliable Requiem includes optional [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) integration so you can tweak almost every aspect of the mod on the fly and instantly apply your changes.
